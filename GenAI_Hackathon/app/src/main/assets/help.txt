Want to make your life more convenient? Want an cyber-eye to help you see?

How-to-guide:
Launching the App: Open the Accessibility App on your device.
Activating Voice Control: Long-press the screen to activate the microphone. This gesture signals the app to listen for voice commands.

"I want to go to the convenience store."
"Take me to school."
"I need to buy something at the mall."
Receiving Feedback: As you navigate, listen for auditory cues from the app. It will inform you of obstacles, changes in terrain, and other critical information about your environment.
Ending the Session: When you are finished using the app or wish to stop the service, simply say "stop" to deactivate the service. The assistant will prepare itself to offer help again!
